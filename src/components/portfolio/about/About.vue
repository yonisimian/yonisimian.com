        <p>
          I'm a {{ age }} years old <strong>Computer Science B.Sc. student</strong>
          {{ isBirthday ? '(today is my birthday ðŸ¥³)' : '' }} at The Open University of Israel. I'm
          currently pursuing my degree and am set to complete it in the summer of 2024. Alongside my
          studies, I have had the incredible opportunity to work as a
          <strong>R&D Software Development student</strong> at Intel since 2022, where I get to
          explore my passion for coding and software development. Visit my

          In addition to my technical interests, I am a <strong>seasoned musician</strong>, having
          played the trombone since the age of 10. I also enjoy playing various other instruments,
          having being participating in various orchestras and bands. Music has always been an
          integral part of my life, and I find immense joy in composing and creating melodies in my
          free time, with a particular fondness for the bass and funk music.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am passionate about <strong>music theory</strong>, viewing it as a human interpretation
          of mathematics, and I actively engage in music composition. Looking forward, one life goal
          of mine is to <strong>revolutionize the landscape of music composition</strong>,
          leveraging modern technology to create innovative and unprecedented musical experiences. I
          believe that the intersection of technology and music offers endless possibilities, and I
          am excited about the prospect of pursuing a Master's degree in Music Technology.
